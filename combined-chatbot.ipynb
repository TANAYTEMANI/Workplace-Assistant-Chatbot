The challenge\nin crisis management is to limit the fallout —notably in the media —to the site and its region.\nThe main categories of crisis are:\n■ Industrial  (fire, explosion, leak of molten glass, equipment failure, etc.).\n■ Labor (conflict, work accident).\n■ Environmental (natural disaster, pollution).\n■ Health (food poisoning, avian flu).\n■ IT (virus, loss of data).\n■ Managerial (harassment, legal investigation, dea th, sabotage, discriminatory hiring practices, etc.).\n■ Acts of malice (theft of sensitive or non -sensitive equipment, break -in, etc.).\n■ Product (recall, product defect resulting in health or technical issues, counterfeiting, etc.).\n■ Crises stemming from equip ment or product transportation (accident, spill, explosion, etc.).\n■ Media (anything having a negative effect on the Company’s / Group’s image on Media)\nIt can also be a situation where in the eyes of the media or general public, our company did not react t o one of the above\nsituations in the appropriate manner.\nThis definition is not all encompassing but rather is designed to give an idea for the types of situations where we may need to\nfollow this plan.\nIf handled correctly the damage can be minimized.\nOne thing to remember that is crucial in a crisis is tell it fast and tell the truth. If we do this, we have done all we can to\nminimize the situation.\nWhen a situation arises that may be a crisis the first action should be to notify the following persons :\n1. Factory/Office Manager\n2. Head – Human Resources\n3. Head – Business Finance\n4. Head – Operations\n5. Head – Environment, Health and Safety\n6. Managing Director\n7. Compliance Committee\nThe sooner we get these people informed and involved, the faster this plan can be implemented.\nOVERVIEW OF A CRISIS SITUATION  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 4}\npage_content='3\nThe process of preparing for a potential crisis is absolutely critical for the sake of our reputation. Without any form of pl anning, a\ncrisis, especially a sudden event, will have  a much more damaging impact on our credibility, particularly when inadequate\ncontingency planning is demonstrated.\nThe basic steps of preparation and planning for crisis management include:\n1. Risk assessment\n2. Detailing the procedures to be followed and to  be put in place to manage the risks if it becomes a crisis\n3. Having necessary resources to handle crisis situations.\n4. Conducting an analysis of persons / groups who will be impacted and all stakeholders involved.\n5. Communication responsibilities, techniques to  inform our employees and other stake holders affected by the crisis.\n6. Planning and executing simulation events periodically for testing our plans for crisis management\n7. Identification and formal notification of the members of crisis management team.\n8. Identif ication and training for media communication for authorized spokespersons.\n9. Awareness creation, Training and documentation to staff and other key stakeholders of our contingency plans\n10. Formalized communication protocol.\nThe purpose of this policy is to help Company managers effectively manage unexpected events that may have a significant\nimpact on our business and to provide procedures for reporting and responding to significant incidents (or “crisis” situation s) as\nefficiently and effectively as possible.\nImmediate objectives of crisis response are to:\n■ Act quickly and responsibly\n■ Keep management informed\n■ Keep employees’ confidence and maintain a calm atmosphere\n■ Keep the crisis from spreading\n■ Minimize disruptions to  operations\n■ Resolve the situation quickly and fully.\nCompany is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen, with high ethical standards and concern for its employees,\ncustomers, neighbors, and other constituents.\nPREPARATION AND PLANNING FOR CRISIS MANAGEMENT\nCRISIS COMMUNICATION POLICY  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 5}\npage_content='4\nA significant incident or “crisis” is any event that seriously upsets the normal business routine. In our diversified lines of\nbusiness, there are various types of potential significant incidents or crisis that the company could en counter.\nIn general, the Company Group in India consider s incidents to be significant if they have caused, or are causing, or could\npotentially cause:\n■ Death of an individual (employee or non -employee) occurring, or as a result of an ev ent, on Company / Group\nproperty, in a Company vehicle, or while on Company / Group business.\n■ Serious harm to employees, other individuals, or impacting public health and safety, arising as a consequence of\nCompany’s  / Group’s operations\n■ Major theft or serious harm to Company’s  / Group’s  assets\n■ Major disruption of the ability to man ufacture, store, sell, or ship   products\n■ Damage to the environment or community arising as a consequence of operations  of the Group\n■ Damage to the public image/reputation of Company Group  or its subsidiaries\n■ Violation of Company’s Business Conduct Guidelines resulting in a significant impact to our Company  / Group .\nThe types of significant incidents which the Company Group in India could encounter fall into three  categories; examples of\neach are provided below:\nNatural calamities or Accidents\nLife-threatening situations, for example:\n■ Accidents resulting in serious injury and/or a fatality\n■ Fires; explosions; fuel leaks; spills of oils, environmental contamination from hazardous wastes (as defined by CPCB -\nCentral Pollution Control Board)\n■ Earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods\n■ Terrorism\nDamages and Threats as a result of intentional acts\n■ Threats of bodily harm or property damage by individuals or organizations\n■ Thefts of company property or funds; breaches of security\n■ Bomb threats, sabotage attempts, or any intentional disruption of operations\n■ Work stoppages caused by wildcat strikes\n■ Attempts to bribe, coerce, or influence company personnel or company -related in terests in any illegal or unwarranted\nmatter\n■ Crimes committed on company property\n■ Perceived or actual violations of Company’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct Guidelines\n■ Industrial espionage\n■ Liabilities arising out of penalties or penal actions le vied by competent authorities\nDamages and Threats as a result of unintentional acts\n■ Due-diligence not done properly while conduction Business\n■ Insensitivity towards local incidents/practices\n■ Improper training / review / control procedures\nWHAT IS A SIGNIFICANT INCIDENT?  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 6}\npage_content='5\nIt is essential to report significant incidents to Crisis  Management Team as quickly as reasonably possible. It is critical to\ndocument details about the incident as soon as possible.\nHere are things we should do in the event of a crisis:\n■ Do not panic. Act composed.\n■ Ensure safety of people & property. Help victims.\n■ Do not spread (or) act on rumors.\n■ Do not rely on memory; record important information including:\n■ A description of what happened and action taken\n■ Date and time of day\n■ Precise loc ation\n■ Weather conditions, if pertinent\n■ Severity\n■ Names of employees or other individuals involved\n■ Current status of employees and/or situation in general.\nIf in doubt over whether or not to report an incident, report it.\nThe Crisis Planning Team will make the determination as to the level of the incident’s significance.\n■ When reporting an incident, provide the following information:\n■ Your name and phone number(s) (24 hours a day)\n■ Name and phone number(s) of second -in-command (24 hours a day)\n■ Facility location  and type\n■ Department / Function\n■ Time and type of incident\n■ Incident details\n■ Injuries, if any\n■ Possible hazards (health, environment)\n■ Current status/contact(s) made.\n■ The Below emergency contacts of our sites must be notified\n■ Factory/Office Manager\n■ Head – Huma n Resources\n■ Head – Business Finance\n■ Head – Operations\n■ Head – Environment, Health and Safety\n■ Managing Director\n■ Compliance Committee\nThe contact list of the Crisis Team members/Key Internal and external contacts are available as annexures and also online in\nSG Village .\nNOTIFICATION PROCEDURE  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 7}\npage_content='6\nThe increasing awareness level of Company activities in our Delegation leads also to an increase of the public interest in\nour Group. The public does not differentiate any longer between each a ctivity and Company.\nOne speaks only of Company.\nAll media inquiries either made to the Company’s  / Delegation’s  listed number or directly to an employee of our Company must\nbe dealt with in strict accordance of the procedure listed below:\n■ We should deal with  the press  in a professional manner .\n■ If we are asked by journalists for information, we should refer them to the Plant Manager or the person who is in\ncharge of communication (Head – Human Resources / Manager – Communications).\n■ If we  cannot reach them, just write down the name of the journalist, where he works, what he would like to know and\nhow we can reach him. Tell them that a responsible person will contact them soon.\n■ All such persons not specifically authorized by the Company / Delegation for responding to external parties must\ndecline any communication requests stating that they are not authorized for any response and must direct the caller to\nHead – Human Resources / Manager - Communications.\n■ No relevant information may be sup plied to the competition by press releases or by giving interviews (new products,\nproduction processes, weaknesses etc.).  Only together we can turn damage away from our enterprise by negative or\nwrong press report.\nHOW TO HANDLE MEDIA INQUIRIES  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 8}\npage_content='7\nThis assessment involves the analysis of two categories of criteria: Discriminating criteria and Aggravating criteria.\nDiscriminating criteria\nPrinciple:   An affirmative response to one of these criteria is sufficient to qualify the event as a potential risk.\nEvent Criteria  Yes No\nAccidental event with serious consequences for casualties (injuries to employees, customers,\npartners, etc.)\nEvent having a significant impact on the health of employees and/or residents and/or customers\nEvent leading to serious pollution of the environment (air, water, soil)\nMultiple incidents of the same type (manufacturing faults, complaints from customers, service\nproviders, etc.)\nPowerful and persistent internal or external rumors calling the responsibility and/or code of\nethics and/or image of the company, profession and/or its partners into question\nIndustrial disputes/Labour unrest  that are likely to attract media attention and/or affect several\nestablishments\nAdministrative and/or legal proceedings involving the company and/or its partners, which could\nquickly attract widespread media coverage\nAny event which could have a major impact on the image of the Company Company, its\nsubsidiaries and its economic units, brands, products, etc.\nAggravating criteria\nPrinciple:  An affirmative response to one of these criteria increases the severity of the crisis.\nEvent Criteria  Yes No\nExistence of an antecedent(previous incidents)\nAggressive reactions (law suits, complaints, etc.)\nMedia coverage (Press, TV, Radio, Internet)\nProceedings taken against a company\nmanager/Accusation of an executive\nLocal and/or national sensitivity surrounding the\nsubject in question\nCRISIS ASSESSMENT CRITERIA  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 9}\npage_content='8\nWhat key steps should be taken in order to mitigate a crisis situation? The following order of events will differ depending\non circumstances, but they represent the principal logical sequence that crisis teams could follow.\nSTAGE 1: Assembling the crisis team\nCrisis Team\n■ Factory/Office Manager -  Deemed Occupier\n■ Head – Human Resources\n■ Head – Business Finance\n■ Head – Operations\n■ Head – Environment, Health and Safety\n■ Managing Director\n■ Compliance Committee\nRole of Crisis Team\n1. Brainstorm the situation and establish facts and details\n2. Identify and agree exactly  what is at stake.\n3. Agree communication objectives and a strategy to achieve them\n4. Identify and prioritize stakeholder groups.\n5. Agree on messages and channels of communication\n6. Assess the legal situation\n7. Media watch: News gathering organizations, Radio, TV, internet, newspaper\n8. If required develop a holding or media statement.\nIt is important to remember that with evolving crisis situations, management must be prepared to act quickly and adjust strat egy\nif required.\nPeriodic briefings\n■ These are conducted by the Head of the Crisis Unit.\n■ To be held regularly – every half -hour or hour at the start of the crisis – so that all members of the crisis unit are in\npossession of the same information.\n■ They must be VE RY SHORT (maximum of 10 minutes).\nPriority Actions to be taken by the Head of the Crisis Unit\n■ In the event of an industrial crisis, ensure that the site in question has taken the necessary protective measures :\nevacuation of people, emergency calls, etc.\n■ Analyze all available information and evaluate the situation;\n■ List the information that is missing or in need of validation;\n■ Send a manager to the scene (especially in the event of transport accidents);\n■ Ensure communication between the crisis site and the h ead office.\n■ Make sure that the functional heads have started compiling the timing chart.\n■ Remind staff of the operational rules for the Crisis Unit and ensure that all members fully understand their roles and\nthose of their colleagues\n■ Remind the receptioni sts of the sites involved about the call transfer instructions\nHANDLING THE CRISIS  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 10}\npage_content='9\n■ Activate the procedure for managing journalists’ calls\n■ In the event of media coverage or if this is imminent, set up a system of media surveillance (local, regional, national) in\nreal time;\n■ Ensure to inform all persons and organizations concerned without delay (Hierarchy, General Delegation, Sector,\nBranch Offices, Sales Offices, Fire Service, Police, Emergency Medical Services, hospitals,  the Regional Office for\nIndustry,  the Local Social Services Department, the Public works department, and the Factory Inspectorate, etc.)\n■ Evaluate the need to summon the assistance of internal or external specialists (and or allies).\n■ Our schedule should be organized such that in order to make our self permanently available during the first 48 hours\nand arrange for a replacement if the crisis looks set to last longer.\nSTAGE 2: Internal Communication\nIn times of crisis, it is essential to make sure that our employees  (at the site in question, at Head Of fice and also at the other\nsites) are the first to be notified. For this case we have got a special information sheet for the notice board. The employee s\nmust know in advance that if they see this information sheet URGENT they have to read it right away. ( Refer appendix)\n■ Ensure that all employees and other impacted stakeholders are aware of the situation before media get to them.\n■ Ensure that employees know that they must direct all queries from public /media to the Head  – Human resources  and\nthe Factory o r Office  site manager\nMake sure that we have the capacity to inform our employees about a serious incident (e.g. the closure of a site following a fire)\nwithin a maximum of two hours  of the event happening and at any time (business hours, evenings, weeke nds and public\nholidays).\nCompile a list of contact information for all employees  (business, home and mobile telephone numbers, fax number, e -mail\naddress).\nIf our employees are alerted by the media rather than the company, the shock could be much worse and the credibility of the\ncompany could be seriously harmed.\nIn the event of a crisis, the information that we issue to the media must be wholly consistent with that which is announced\ninternally.\nSTAGE 3: Releasing a Media Statement  (if required)\nControlling the flow of information to the media is one of the keys to crisis management.\nManager – Communications to w rite out the key messages and make sure it is approved by the Crisis Committee .\nIf we are not communicating right away, we will lose th e best opportunity to control the events.\n■ First step is always to write a short press release which includes following aspects :\n■ What has happened?\n■ Where?\n■ When?\n■ Do not speculate about the causes, Concentrate on the facts.\n■ Show that we are willing to do everything for clarifying the situation; we have the situation under control and explain\nmeasures that have been put into operation by the emergency services.  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 11}\npage_content='10\n■ If there are casualties, it is essential that a message of support be issued to families, coll eagues, etc.\n■ Avoid using confusing language: a description of the situation is better than valuations.\n■ Do not underestimate the severity of the situation and do not make uncorroborated declarations.\n■ For example, avoid saying: “Fortunately, there have been  no casualties”, when people present at the time of\nthe accident remain unaccounted for,\n■ Likewise:  saying “There will be no environmental damage” is ill advised while the impact on the environment\nremains unknown and in a situation which is likely to chan ge, etc.\n■ Be sure that all (management, employees, involved persons) are aware about the content of the press release.\n■ Please have in mind that others  like police, fire brigade, health authorities or other public authorities have also their\nspokesmen . Identify them as soon as possible ; contact them in order to come to an agreement about the following\naction and to coordinate the inquiries together.\nSTAGE 4:  Crisis communication and monitoring\nThe designated spokesman engages in communications with st akeholders and the media. The principle is simple: no\nexclusive coverage . We have to remind the media that this situation is an exceptional case . We have to show them how\ngood our company works usually.  We have to repeat our key messages as often as we can  – even if we have the feeling that\nwe recur.  The journalist’s questions give us the opportunity to transmit our key messages to the general public.\nPrepare handouts, diagrams, pictures, etc.\n■ This stage could involve crisis release up -dates.\n■ Press conferences or talking to each journalist personally?\n■ Check if a press conference is the proper instrument for this kind of crisis.\n■ Just we have to ask our self: Can and do we want to say more than the press release contents? Are we\naware and well prepared  to answer aggressive questions in the audience? Could this press conference give\nthis crisis to much importance?\n■ Stay on message\n■ Monitor all information coming  in and reassess the strategy : The scenarios method\n■ This gives a view of how the crisis situatio n is likely to develop and enables the necessary precautions,\nmeasures and responses to be anticipated.\nThe following questions must be asked, depending on the situation:\n■ What if? Consider the worst -case scenarios.\n■ What next? Systematically consider the po ssible consequences.\nMonitor the media response and evaluate spokespeople\nDon’t forget:\n■ The press coverage could last more than one or two days, e.g. three weeks.\n■ Think of recovery phases for team/deputy.\n■ The shock in the enterprise concerned could be enormous, try to diminish it together with external aids (less emotional,\nbecause not directly concerned).\n■ Defending attitude kills reliability.\n■ Show consternation, no tears.\n■ Avoid PR phrases during the crisis.\n' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 12}\npage_content='11\nDuring crisis communication we should kee p strict to the rules:\n■ All what we say must be true.\n■ The communication must be appropriate.\n■ Simplify, without falsifying, because lack of understanding produces fear.\nOnce the crisis has passed, we need to review its lessons. We need to inform our main contacts, while asking them to remain\nvigilant. Remember to thank everyone who helped and supported us during this critical time. If appropriate, we need to contac t\nour c ustomers to reassure them. We should bring our employees together to analyze the event and its consequences, from the\nfirst warning signs to the present. We should take this opportunity to further raise their awareness about the risk of a cris is and\nimprov e our risk management strategies.\nA post incident review should look at\n■ Evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the crisis team and outcomes\n■ Understanding the lessons learned\n■ Analyzing media opinion and public perceptions and opinion\n■ Preparing a final report for key stakeholders: both internal and external\n■ Maintaining contact with stakeholders, try to cement relationships e.g. site visit etc.\n■ Preparing case studies and educating all employees\n■ Put into operation lessons learned and assimilate into contingency planning and simulations\nAftershocks\nWe should not let our guard down —if a similar event occurs in the weeks following the original crisis, the consequences can be\ncatastrophic. The media crisis can make us lose sight of the real crisis. Although the media may have moved on, the crisis it self\nmay not be finished. All this to say, we should not wrap things up too quickly.\nPOST CRISIS MANAGEMENT  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 13}\npage_content='12\nAPPENDICES\nOne individual should be designated as the primary spokesperson by the Crisis Management Team to\n■ Represent the Company\n■ Make official statements\n■ Answer media questions throughout the crisis.\nA back-up to the designated spokesperson should also be identified to fill the position in the event that the primary\nspokesperson is unavailable.\nCriteria for the spokesperson, backup spokesperson are:\n■ Comfortable in front of a TV camera and with reporters.\n■ Preferably, skilled in handling media\n■ Skilled in directing responses to another topic\n■ Skilled in identifying key points\n■ Able to speak without using jargon\n■ Respectful of the role of the reporter\n■ Knowledgeable about the organization and the crisis at hand\n■ Able to establish credibility with the media\n■ Able to project confidence to the audience\n■ Suitable in regard to\n■ Diction\n■ Appearance\n■ Charisma\n■ Sincere\n■ Straightforward\n■ Believable\n■ Accessible to the media and to internal communications personnel who will facilitate media interviews\n■ Able to remain calm in stressful situations\nIn addition to the designated spokesperson and backup, it can be anticipated that other parties involved in the crisis. Police,\nFire department, Health officials, etc., will also have a spokesperson. It is important to obtain the identity of that indivi dual as\nearly as possible so all statements and contacts with the media can be coordi nated between the two individuals and their\norganizations/interests whenever possible.\nAPPENDIX 1 - DESIGNATED SPOKESPERSONS  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 14}\npage_content='13\nA crisis situation is always difficult when dealing with the media. Therefore, tough questions and rehearsals are necessary to\nhelp the spokesperson prepare.\nIt is important, at the onset of the crisis, that the spokesperson, backup and advisors spend some time rehearsing prepared\nstatements and answers to possible \"tough\" questions that may be asked by reporters.\nIf possible, similar rehearsals should be conducted prior to each media interview, briefing or news conference.\nIt is also important to anticipate and practice new questions as the story evolves.\nIt is better to over -prepare than to be surprised by the depth  of questioning by the media. Be tough and be prepared.\nThe Communications/Public Relations staff ( under Head – Human R esources) should prepare questions and answers for the\npractice sessions. These questions and answers should be for internal use only and  not for distribution outside the organization.\nDon't volunteer information unless it is a point the company wants to make and the question hasn't been asked.\nPrepared statements\nIf we don't communicate immediately, we lose our greatest opportunity to control events.\n(Following is a template for news release that can be used with little or no preparation as our first news release). Our firs t news\nrelease should include at a minimum The Who, What, When and Where of the situation .\n■ We must give the facts that have been gathered from reliable sources and confirmed. Don't overreach and don't\nspeculate. There is a limit to our role. To exceed that limit is a mistake.\n■ If we do nothing more than show concern for the public and for our employees in our first pre ss interaction, we are\nalready on the right track.\n■ The corollary of expressing concern and generating good will at the consumer level is securing the loyalty of our\ncustomers and employees by taking the initiative to share information with them. If our em ployees and customers don't\nfeel like insiders, they are going to act like outsiders.\n■ We must have a prepared statement on hand that can be used to make an initial general response to the media when\nknowledge about the crisis first becomes known on a wides pread basis or by reporters.\n■ As the crisis progresses and new information and facts become available, it is also advisable to develop prepared\nstatements to be made by the spokesperson at the onset of any media interview, briefing or news conference.\n■ These  prepared statements also can be read over the telephone to reporters who call to request information but are\nnot represented at news conferences or briefings. The statement can also be sent by FAX or e -mail upon request.\nAPPENDIX 2 – MEDIA HANDLING GUIDELINES  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 15}\npage_content='14\nA ___________________ at ____________________ involving __________________ occurred today at ________________.\nThe incident is under investigation and more information is forthcoming.\nA (what happened) at (location) involving (who) occurred today at (time). The incident is under investigation and more\ninformation is forthcoming.\nFor instance:\nAn explosion at 12/10 Market Street, the main plant for the Indian Toy Company occurred today at 3 p.m. The incident is under\ninvestigation an d more information is forthcoming.\nWe can put down a definitive time for the next news conference or release of information if we know it but it is not necessar y.\nThis will not solve our problems, but we may have enough time to prepare for the next news c onference or release.\nWe can also add information if it is available such as how many casualties there are known up to this point or any other\npertinent information available. Once again, this information should be definitive and not speculative , verify e verything we say.\nThis will help our credibility in the long run.\nInformation brochures or fact sheets about the company or the area in which the crisis has occurred are helpful in informing the\nreporters or anyone else seeking information about the compa ny.\n“Any potential crisis or problem is likely to attract the interest of the media. Therefore, they will stop at nothing in orde r to find\nout everything they can about our company, colleagues, suppliers, products, customers and, of course, our problems.\nJournalists will try to catch us off -guard and will show us no mercy in their questioning.\nThey will also interrogate other people involved in the incident (customers, competitors, specialists, associations, mayors, local\nresidents, etc.)”\nThe press rel ease must correspond to the Corporate Design of the Group.\nAPPENDIX 3 – TEMPLATES FOR NE WS/PRESS RELEASE  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 16}\npage_content='15\nDate\nHeading/May be\nsub heading\nMain Text\nPress Contact\nLeave Broad Space on the\nRight Hand Side\nAbout the Company\nEntity\nLOGO\n' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 17}\npage_content='16\nA press conference is organized according to very strict rules. There are traditionally three parts devoted to business and o ne to\nsocializing .\nThe introductory presentation\nLasting 15 to 20 minutes, this is usually delivered by the main speaker , who  may or may not, depending on the circumstances,\nbe assisted by one or two speakers acting as experts on the subject in question.\nThe main speaker is the presenter, the “boss” of the press conference. He/she firstly introduces himself/herself and then the\nexpert(s):\n■ First name, surname (avoiding “ May I introduce X”, which does not show team spirit),\n■ Job title and role (a title on its own often means nothing to the audience: they need to know what the job entails)\nThe speaker starts off by presenting the  main information and assesses the consequences for the company , but most\nimportantly, shows he/she is on the side of the general public (benefits/risks).\nThe speaker should not try to cover too many details, as it is important to give the journalists an opportunity to ask questions\nafterwards.\nRemember that journalists, by definition, are inquisitive. Make sure they stay that way until the end.\nGive concrete examples . To us, this may sometimes seem simplistic, but we will find that it is best to start out with the\nsimplest elements in order to promote an understanding of the overall situation and not vice versa.\nHumors are not forbidden, but use it sparingly and avoid irony, which might be taken literally.\nBe careful about any passing references to ou r competitors . It is obvious that these are likely to be seized on by the\njournalists. Only mention them if you really want to see them in print and after you have assessed the potential fallout that  might\nresult.\nThe question and answer session\nThis last s approximately 30 minutes . The time should be announced beforehand and should obviously be adhered to.  The\nspeaker either answers the questions or passes them on to one of the experts, depending on the particular nature of the\nquestion that is asked. Answers must be short and accurate. Avoid giving long presentations.\nDo not try to dodge difficult questions.\nDo not pass judgment or comment on any of the questions asked. When a particular journalist is congratulated for asking an\nexcellent question, i t is always somewhat irritating for the others.\nOne thing is essential: Make sure we have prepared our answers to as many questions as possible in advance.\nAPPENDIX 4  - PRESS CONFERENCE  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 18}\npage_content='17\nThe final summary\nAfter the interactive session, the main speaker delivers the final summary.\nHe/she goes over the incident and the issues at stake very briefly and may mention the timetable for the actions to come.\nHe/she gives thanks to the participants but not to his colleagues and announces that a press kit is available on the way out.\nHe/she ann ounces that cocktails or coffee will follow.\nThe Media archive\nIt is very important to be aware of any accidents and/or crises that may have affected the site, sector of industry, Group or the\nindustry in question in the past.\nIndeed, the media systematically use the question: “So, this has happened before and you did Nothing about it?” as an angle of\nattack.\nFurthermore, and as the media know only too well, a succession of similar accidents will provoke a speedier and more intense\nemotional res ponse from the public.\nThus, it is necessary to gather any type of information that might prove to be useful for answering questions posed by the\nmedia. This is the “M edia archive” .\nGuidelines for successful media interviews: Prepare, Prepare, Prepare\nKeep in mind that a person being interviewed has certain rights:\n■ To know who is doing the interviewing and for whom\n■ To know the nature of the story (background of the story)\n■ To work out ground rules for the inte rview (specific topics; whether photographs will be allowed and, if so, whether\nthey will be of people or facilities; where and when the interview will take place)\n■ To tape the interview (tell the interviewer that we are taping)\nTo prepare for the intervie w:\n■ Decide in advance the positive messages that we want to get across.\n■ Make a list of questions that will probably be asked; rehearse answers.\n■ Practice, with someone else taking the role of the interviewer. Listen for answers that could be misunderstood or  that\nsound insincere or incomplete.\n■ Practice emphasizing our main positive message.\n■ Know the news of the day that might affect our business, so we should be prepared in case we are asked to comment\non it.\nFollow these tips during the interview (to be add ed in our rehearsals):\n■ Never make a “no comment” response.\n■ Never lie.\n■ Never speak “off the record”. There’s no such thing.\n■ Never repeat a negative statement made in an interviewer’s question. Rephrase the remark in a positive way.\n■ If we don’t know an answe r, say so; say that we will get the answer to the reporter before his or her deadline, and do it.\nAPPENDIX 5 – MEDIA INTERVIEW GUIDELINES  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 19}\npage_content='18\n■ Use the transition technique; give a straight answer to a sticky question, then move the conversation in a direction that\nallows us to emphasize the positive message we have defined.\n■ Do not answer hypothetical questions, do not speculate and do not repeat rumors. Be factual and stick to our main\npoint.\n■ Speak in a conversational tone, without jargon, using examples to illustrate our points.\n■ Use our answers to ma ke positive points we have decided beforehand to make.\n■ For television and radio, keep responses short ; a long response requires editing which might result in our comments\nbeing taken out of context or not used at all.\n■ Don’t blame anyone, or accept blame, f or an emergency before all the facts are in.\n■ Stay calm, courteous and cooperative, even if the interviewer seems to be hostile.\n■ Keep our promises. If we say that we will call the reporter back with some information, do it.\nHere are some further tips for television interviews:\n■ Be on camera. Though it’s difficult when we’re not used to being in the spotlight, try to relax. Viewers will judge the\nstory on the basis of how we look and act as well what we say.\n■ Look at the interviewer, not at the camera.\n■ Do not  make nervous gestures.\n■ Wear solid -color clothes (no patterns), a pastel/grey shirt or blouse (not white or black), and avoid distracting or\nreflective jewelry or other items (e.g. logo pins).\nCHECKLIST FOR AN INTERVIEW\nGeneral\n1. Being well prepared\n2. Phrasin g our main positive messages (3 or 5 messages; 3 is best)\n3. Get in advance information about the background of the story; where it will be published – what kind of media\n(Radio, press; magazine, TV show,) and then decide if it’s worth to do it.\n4. Talk to the i nterviewer in advance about the duration and the course of the conversation\n5. Keep the agreed timing\n6. Keep relaxed\n7. Speak naturally\n8. Don’t read off\n9. Keep responses short\n10. Even if the questions are provoking us - keep to the facts and positive messages\nSpecifical ly for TV\n1.  Pay attention to our posture and gestures\n2.  Pay attention to the film location (e.g. background of the person who will be interviewed: Are there any logos? Is it\ncleared up? )\n3. No dark blue, green, black or white clothes / no patterns / no loud colors (we don’t look good on the screen in\nsuch colors)\n4. Calm movements\n5. Look into the face of the journalist during the interview – not at the camera\n' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 20}\npage_content='19\n■ The facts\n■ What has happened?\n■ Can you summarize the situation for us?\n■ Are there any casualties?\n■ Are the emergency services on the scene?\n■ How long do you think it will take to get the situation under control?\n■ Risk of further accidents?\n■ What is the Environmental impact (air, water, soil)?\n■ Are em ployees and residents in immediate danger?\n■ Toxicity of products to blame?\n■ Responsibility, cause\n■ What are the causes of the accident?\n■ Who is responsible?\n■ Do you consider yourself to be responsible?\n■ Is this the case of a Human error/negligence/mechanical fa ult/ etc .?\n■ Antecedents?\n■ What will you do to prevent the same thing happening in the future?\n■ Weaknesses\n■ Legal nonconformity.\n■ Errors, mistakes committed and covered up.\n■ Surprise witnesses (former employee, “specialist”, etc.)\n■ Action plan\n■ What actions are you going to take?\n■ Impact on the business and the viability of the site?\n■ Return to normal?\n■ Internal, Labor relations\n■ Sanctions, if the responsibility is internal.\n■ Resulting dangers: temporary layoffs, closure, etc.\n■ Links between the incident and reduction s in the workforce or restructuring policy.\n■ Trade union reactions, etc.\n■ Financial aspects\n■ How much will it cost?\n■ Are you adequately insured?\n■ What can you say to reassure the financial markets?\n■ Will you pass on the cost to your customers?\n■ Communication\n■ Comments on your public relations policy.\n■ Request for transparency and access to information.\nAPPENDIX 6  – QUESTIONS LIKELY TO BE ASKED BY MEDIA  ' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 21}\npage_content='20\n■ Speculation about what is left unsaid.\n■ Rumors\n■ These are the driving force behind the most impertinent questions (“One of your competitors, one of your former\nemployees has said that …”)\n■ Technical\n■ Do not fall into the trap of discussing technical aspects in an emotionally sensitive situation\n■ Sensationalism, exploiting the emotional angle\n■ E.g. “Do you have anything to say to the parents of casualties who are listening?”\n“Would you let your own children drink the tap water?”\n“You knew about it, yet you did/said nothing”\n■ The profit / safety dilemma.\n■ Previous, contradictory statements (made internally or by other interested parties)\n■ Quotes g iven by other parties, which contradict your position in the hope of stirring up controversy.\n■ Can this really happen in our country?\n■ Haven’t we narrowly avoided a major catastrophe?\n■ The future\n■ What will change with regard to the employees and/or the system?\n■ It’s a terrible blow for the Group, etc.\n■ Does this mean the end for the business?\n■ Have you considered tendering your resignation?\n' metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Crisis Communication and Management Handbook for India Delegation_V0.3.docx.pdf', 'page': 22}\npage_content='21\nThis information sheet should be used only in emergency cases put on ea ch notice board at the site.

It can\ntake a heavy toll on people, companies and industry. It can undermine morale, erode\nproductivity and foster a hostile work environment for everyone in the workplace. Incidents of sexual harassment result in painful experiences for the victims and the\nGroup/Company.\nCompany’s policy is to prohibit se xual harassment of any kind and from any\nperson, be it a supervisor, co-worker, manager, supplier, customer or business associate. Any employee found to have engaged in sexual harassment, after an impartial investigation, will receive prompt  disciplinary action, up to and including\ndismissal. If the harasser is a supplier or customer, appropriate action will be taken\nto end the harassment and prevent future occurrences.\nSexual harassment may be defined as unwelcome advances, requests for sexual\nfavours, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:\n1. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or\ncondition of an individual’s employment, pay revision, promotions or retention.\n2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the\nbasis for employment or business decisions affecting such individual, or\n3.

Although confronting the harasser\nmay be difficult, you are encouraged to do so in a firm manner, irrespective of\nthe rank and position of the harasser.\n If there is a physical harassment, firmly separate yourself and let it be known in\nclear words that you are offended by such actions.\n If you do not feel comfortable confronting the harasser, or if the harassment\ncontinues even after your resistance, take it up with Human Resources, the\nperson you report to, or a higher level manager whom you trust.\nAll complaints of sexual harassment will be  investigated promptly and impartially.\nEach of us has a right to work in an environment of dignity and respect.
